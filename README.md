# keeping roommates up to date.

***Web-based display for my flat, showing bus departures, garbage collection dates and hopefully a lot of more useful stuff.***

You can have a **look at a demo** instance of this code here: [resolution1.net/w61-webdisplay](http://resolution1.net/w61-webdisplay)

This HTML is to be used / displayed on a screen in the kitchen, driven by a [RaspberryPi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/). Maybe lateron it will be also served to the Internet for having a look at it from outside, then best with a style optimized for mobile devices.
For information on setting it up on a RaspberryPi have a look at the folder ´[raspberrypi]`(raspberrypi) and its **[readme](raspberrypi/README.md)**

You got an ***idea for further information*** that should be presented? Just create a *[New Issue](https://github.com/semaphor/w61-webdisplay/issues)* to describe it. Any other “issues” are also very welcome ;-)


## Status

* Clearly work in progress, constantly ;-)
* Currently it's optimized to the actual resolution of our screen (1024x768 px), which is so far mostly hard coded. I Don't like it but there's some lack of time.
