# keeping roommates up to date.

Web-based display for my flat, showing bus departures, garbage collection dates and hopefully a lot of more useful stuff.

This HTML is to be used / showed on a screen[1] in the kitchen, driven by a [RaspberryPi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/). Maybe it will be also served to the Internet for having a look at it from outside, then best with a style optimized for mobile devices.
For setting it up on a RaspberryPi have a look at the folder ´[raspberrypi]`(raspberrypi) and its **[readme](raspberrypi/README.md)**

You got an ***idea for further information*** that should be presented? Just create a *[New Issue](https://github.com/semaphor/w61-webdisplay/issues)* to describe it. Any other “issues” are also very welcome ;-)


[1] So currently it's optimized to the actual resolution of our screen (1024x768 px), which is so far mostly hard coded (only due to the lack of time).
