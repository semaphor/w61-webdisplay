# keeping me and my roommates up to date.

Web-based display for my flat, showing bus departures, garbage collection dates and hopefully a lot of more useful stuff for the live in our flat.

This HTML is to be used / showed on a screen in the kitchen, driven by a [RaspberrPi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/). Maybe it will be also served to the Internet for having a look at it from outside, then best with a style optimized for mobile devices.
